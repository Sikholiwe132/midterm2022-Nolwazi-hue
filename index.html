                <p> My name is Sikholiwe Sibisi I have been a web developer for 5 years and have since 
                    created websites for many clients. My love for developing started when a friend of mine had a business idea
                    and needed someone to create a website for them. I told them I would as a joke but what started as a joke turned into
                    a passion I can not describe. I went to school, got the necessary qualifications and have been creating 
                    the perfect scenario's for people since!
